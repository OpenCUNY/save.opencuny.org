  	</div>
  	<h1>Tell your DGSC Representatives to support OpenCUNY at the Plenary Meeting, 22 March 2024.</h1>
  	<h1>What is the proposal up for vote?</h1>
  	 <p>At the next plenary, representatives will vote to change to the DGSC bylaws, replacing the text of §4.3.</p>
  	 <p>Currently, the section is titled “Free Open Source Medium” and defines the mission, governance, and coordinator responsibilities for OpenCUNY. The text acknowledges that students have ongoing interest in ensuring that free, open source tools are available at the Graduate Center, and creates OpenCUNY to protect students’ freedom of speech by offering a digital platform free of CUNY’s control, and advocate for open source technology.</p>
  	 <p>The proposed text eliminates this commitment and infrastructure, replacing OpenCUNY with a Technology Director tasked with maintaining the DGSC website (<a href="#proposal">“Bylaws Proposal”</a>).</p>
  	 <p>The proposal further directs sites currently hosted by OpenCUNY to migrate to the CUNY Commons by 1 July 2024—a migration affecting over 600 sites, including for GC Programs, Student Associations, Chartered Organizations, the Adjunct Project and <span class="italic">Advocate</span>.</p>
  	<h1>Why should the proposal be rejected?</h1>
  	 <p><em>First, the proposal harms the ability for GC students to exercise their freedom of speech by eliminating the only free-to-use digital medium under student control, and outside of CUNY’s oversight.</em> CUNY does not have a policy affirming the importance of free expression or describing what, if any, limits may be imposed, other than the Henderson Rules, and CUNY has moved in recent months towards further suppressing students’ ability to use CUNY digital assets to organize and advocate for policy that benefits students over administrators (<a href="#verzani">Verzani</a>). In February, CUNY’s Board of Trustees voted to make the already restrictive “Policy on Acceptable Use of Digital Assets and Resources” more stringent(<a href="#policy">“Policy”</a>). Amidst budget negotiations and the transition to Brightspace, CUNY Central’s impulse to consolidate and centralize digital platforms threatens the funding of existing free speech platforms on all campuses, including the CUNY Academic Commons here at the GC.</p>
  	 <p><em>Second, the proposal conflates a commitment to providing students a free open source digital medium with a website manager.</em> Hiring a Technology Director should be considered separately to ending OpenCUNY.</p>
  	 <p><em>Third, even if it’s decided OpenCUNY should end, this proposal fails to provide a timeline that allows the WordPress site to wind down responsibly.</em> All site participants, including programs and alumni, should be notified that migrating their sites will affect their rights and given adequate time to opt-in to the migration; support should be provided to participants who want to take their sites elsewhere or delete data from the server, following OpenCUNY’s Terms of Participation.</p>
  	<h1>If the proposal succeeds, how will students and DGSC Affiliates be affected?</h1>
  	 <p><em>OpenCUNY, with non-CUNY servers, a student-focused and written Terms of Participation, and under the oversight of students through the DGSC, ensures students have a free speech platform for researching, teaching, and organizing.</em></p>
     <p>Supporting OpenCUNY helps protect against the following scenarios:</p>
     <ul>
  		<li>During upcoming contract negotiations, the Adjunct Project publishes information to its website about a strike authorization vote. CUNY Administrators remove the content claiming it violates the Taylor Law.</li>
  		<li>An op-ed published to the Advocate website proposes a protest of new GC policy, listing a time, place, and asking participants to bring noise-makers. GC administrators block access to the website claiming it promotes “disorderly conduct.”</li>
  		<li>A student creates a WordPress site that parodies CUNYFirst. CUNY administrators remove the site after CUNY legal claims the parodied logo violates CUNY’s trademark.</li>
      <li>In the context of a lawsuit involving CUNY, your personal communications or files may be examined by CUNY or disclosed publicly in accordance with the New York State Freedom of Information Law (<a href="#policy">“Policy”</a>).</li>
  	 </ul>
    <h1>Is OpenCUNY just a WordPress site?</h1>
      <p><em>No. OpenCUNY is meant to be both a model of deliberate digital community building, implementing technology in a way that prioritizes the DGSC’s democratic values of transparency, accessibility, and student-control, and a means of empowering GC students with knowledge and tools to create and organize in their own communities.</em></p>
      <p>One way OpenCUNY advocates for open source tools is by creating workshops and hosting talks on issues related to open source technology. Workshops offered this year include “<a href ="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTtaBvESus0nM_CfqF9aTsWA1bq4FRkhnwvltQtMv40IZTu1umh0ddg76SidmLA_b-V_PAAsc--grEZ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000" target="_blank" title="Open slides in new tab">Managing your Digital Footprint</a>” and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRGqkM1S2woRi1p5FcMgHqMd5Th2cQs6m6KBP0KD9HiaYSO6FppNvsGGxoSRPe4Du15We3vaDwhAn3o/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000" target="_blank" title="Open slides in new tab">“Hack our Theme!: Creating and Customizing Your Own WordPress Theme.”</a></p>
      <p>Another way OpenCUNY advocates for open source tools is by researching, proposing, and developing new open source platforms and tools. OpenCUNY.org was the first tool, but it’s not the only tool in development.</p>
    <p>Some of the future OpenCUNY projects planned and under consideration include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>OpenCUNY.org Community Node</em> - Tool helping to foster community by surfacing public work being done on OpenCUNY.org and connecting participants with shared interests and constituencies. Plugins powering the first iteration of the node became security vulnerabilities and so the node was removed in 2020, pending a site redesign. After developing and releasing an open source OpenCUNY theme for the new landing page last year, recreating the Community Node is the next step in the site redesign.</li>
      <li><em>OpenCUNY Institutional History and Timeline</em> - Project to document the oral and written history of OpenCUNY since its founding, including a timeline of OpenCUNY’s development, along with interviews and submissions from former coordinators, participants and supporters.</li> 
      <li><em>Sandstorm Multisite</em> - Open source platform for hosting web apps. While WordPress only allows you to create a website, Sandstorm allows you to create multiple applications such as Etherpad (open source Google Docs), Rochet Chat, and Davros (open source DropBox/Google Drive). No CUNY campus is offering any of these services.</li>
      <li><em>Omeka</em> - Open source platform for the display of archives, scholarly collections and exhibitions. No CUNY campus is offering this service.</li>
      <li><em>VPN</em> -  Mechanism for browsing the internet securely and evading content filters. CUNY offers a VPN, but students report it is insufficient.</li>
      <li><em>Link shortner</em> - Transforms long links into memorable ones and prevents some forms of tracking. A CUNY affiliated shortner could be useful at conferences, in social media posts, and in organizing. Like the recently created <a href="https://opencuny.org/qr-generator/" title="Go to QR code generator" target="_blank">QR code generator</a>, it is a tool that requires no additional resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What about the Cost?</h1>
      <p>OpenCUNY’s cost is similar to the other affiliates, the <span class="italic">Advocate</span> and Adjunct Project. According to the 2021 preliminary budget (the most recent budget publicly available), the Adjunct Project was budgeted $21,164, OpenCUNY $24,869, and the Advocate $26,817 (<a href="#doctoral">“Doctoral”</a>). Each of these Affiliates represents a commitment by the DGSC to free speech, community-led governance, and fair wages.</p>
      <p>The actual cost of running the WordPress site is minimal. In 2023, the DGSC paid only $3,709.40 for servers, or roughly $310 a month (<a href="#payments">Payments"</a>).</p>
      <p>Some proponents of the proposal argue the cost-cutting is necessary to give Steering Committee members fair compensation for their labor. Again, be skeptical of the austerity rhetoric. The DGSC can fully fund OpenCUNY and compensate Steering Committee members fairly. Even if cost-cutting is needed in the future, savings can be achieved without eliminating any DGSC platforms, services, or programs.</p>
    <h1>How can DGSC Representatives support OpenCUNY?</h1>
      <p><em>Vote down the proposal to end OpenCUNY.</em></p>
      <p>Help get the word out to fellow students about the need to support academic and expressive freedom on digital platforms at CUNY.</p>
      <p>Urge Steering to begin the hiring process and return OpenCUNY to three coordinators, as proscribed in the bylaws.</p>
      <p>Give the new team a semester to get their bearings and propose a course of action in full discussion with, and with full support of, the OpenCUNY community and DGSC representatives.</p>
